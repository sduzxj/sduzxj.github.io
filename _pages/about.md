## About Me

I am a 3rd-year CS PhD student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tianshu Yu](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/yutianshu/). My research focuses on graph-based machine learning and AI applications in scientific domains. 

Before my PhD, I obtained my M.S. in Data Science from the City University of Hong Kong under the supervision of [Dr. Ruocheng Guo](https://rguo12.github.io/), and my B.S. in Computer Science from Shandong University under the supervision of [Prof. Xuemeng Song](https://xuemengsong.github.io/).

## Research Interests

- **Graph Augmented Intelligence**
- **Efficient Graph Representation Learning**
- **AI4Science**
- **Important applications in the real world (recommendation systems, etc.)**
