## Short Bio

Hi, I am a second-year CS PhD student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, under the supervision of [Prof.Tianshu Yu](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/yutianshu/). I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science from Shandong University under the supervision of [Prof.Xuemeng Song](https://xuemengsong.github.io/). After that, I obtained my M.S. in Data Science from the City University of Hong Kong under the supervision of [Dr.Ruocheng Guo](https://rguo12.github.io/).

## Research Interests:
* Graph representation learning

## Education

* B.S. in Computer Science, Shandong University (Data Science Elite Class)
* M.S. in Data Science, City University of Hong Kong

## Experience
* Visiting PhD student, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Science.
