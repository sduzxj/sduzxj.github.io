## Short Bio

Hi, I am a second-year CS PhD student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, under the supervision of [Prof. Tianshu Yu](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/yutianshu/). I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science from Shandong University under the supervision of [Prof. Xuemeng Song](https://xuemengsong.github.io/). After that, I obtained my M.S. in Data Science from the City University of Hong Kong under the supervision of [Dr. Ruocheng Guo](https://rguo12.github.io/).

## Research Interests:

* Efficient Graph Representation Learning.


## Experience
* Visiting PhD student, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Science, hosted by Prof. Shu Wu
